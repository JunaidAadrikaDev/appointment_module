              ECHO
              <p>
                An echocardiogram, or echo, is a type of ultrasound or sonogram
                imaging test. It uses a transducing device that translates sound
                wave echoes into moving images of the heart. Our doctor uses an
                echocardiogram to look at the heartâ€™s size and structure, and to
                see how well it pumps blood. An echocardiogram evaluates many
                heart problems, including heart murmurs, heart failure, and
                heart valve disease. An echocardiogram is only one method used
                to monitor and diagnose heart conditions.
